# C++ Lab

A personal C++ template and playground for competitive programming, algorithm exploration, and quantitative/low-latency practice.

## Features

- Predefined type aliases and utility functions for fast coding
- Ready-to-use print/debug helpers for STL containers
- Template setup suitable for 1D â†’ 4D vectors, pairs, tuples, maps, etc.
- Simple, minimalistic structure for experimentation and learning

## Compile and Run

```bash
g++-15 -std=c++23 -O2 -g -o build/main main.cpp
./build/main
```

- `-std=c++23` : Use the latest C++ standard
- `-O2` : Optimization for speed
- `-g` : Include debug symbols for debugging

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cpp-lab
```

2. Edit `main.cpp` or add new files for testing algorithms.
3. Compile and run as shown above.

## Notes

- This repository is meant for **C++ experimentation**.
- Not intended as a production library.
